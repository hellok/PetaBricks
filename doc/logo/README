The PetaBricks logo was custom-evolved using PonyGE [1], an
evolutionary graphics program which generates populations of designs
and allows the user to iteratively select, mate and mutate them. It
was then processed and edited using Inkscape [2]. The colours are
CSAIL standard. Evolution and design by James McDermott [3].
