I. Compiling

To compile the autotuner on a Debian system, first install the necessary packages:

# apt-get install ghc6 libghc6-mtl-dev libghc6-parsec-dev libghc6-haxml-dev

then call make, which will produce an executable called "autotune"

NOTE: the compiling instructions were tested on Ubuntu 9.10, but should 
      work with any recent Debian-based system


II. Running

To run the autotuner, simply call the "autotune" executable. "autotuner -h" will 
print a list of available options.

When autotuning a given benchmark, make sure it has already been compiled by pbc.

The autotuner periodically does a comparison against Jason's autotuner, for
which it requires a config file named <benchmark>.cfg.jason to be present in
the benchmark's directory.
